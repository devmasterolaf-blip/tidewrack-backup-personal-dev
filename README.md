# Tidewrack

A narrative adventure set on a fog-bound island off the Washington coast. You
are the new keeper of **Cape Marrow Light**. The keeper before you, Edith Vane,
rowed out into the fog eleven days ago and did not come back.

Built solo by **Fogline Games** (Seattle) in **Godot 4**, shipping to Steam.

> **Status:** Vertical slice. Title screen → the lighthouse ground floor → a
> branching conversation with save/load. See [`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md)
> for the road to launch.

## Controls

| Action        | Key                     |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Move          | Arrow keys              |
| Interact      | Enter / Space           |
| Advance / skip line | Enter / Space     |
| Pause / back  | Esc                     |

The game uses only Godot's built-in input actions, so it works with no input
remapping (controller support and remappable keys are a Public Demo milestone).

## Running it

Requires **Godot 4.3+** (standard, non-.NET build).

```bash
# Open in the editor
godot -e --path .

# Or run directly
godot --path .
```

The main scene is `scenes/main_menu.tscn`. Saves are written to Godot's
`user://save.json` (per-OS user data dir).

```

**Design note:** UI and levels are constructed in GDScript rather than authored
as large scene files. This keeps `.tscn` files small and reviewable in diffs and
avoids merge pain — a deliberate choice for a one-person studio.

## The dialogue system

Conversations are plain JSON graphs in `data/dialogue/`. Each node is either a
linear line (`"next": "<id>"`, or `null` to end) or a choice node (`"choices"`).
Any node can set story flags via `"set_flag"`, which `GameState` persists.

```json
{
  "start": { "speaker": "Edith", "text": "…", "next": "choice1" },
  "choice1": {
    "text": "…",
    "choices": [
      { "text": "Trust her", "next": "end", "set_flag": { "trusted_edith": true } }
    ]
  },
  "end": { "speaker": "", "text": "…", "next": null }
}
```

## Verifying changes

```bash
# Validate every dialogue graph (targets resolve, has an ending, no orphans)
python3 tests/validate_dialogue.py

# In-engine checks (requires Godot on PATH)
godot --headless --path . --check-only   # parse all scripts
```

> The GDScript in this build was authored without a local Godot install, so it
> has been checked statically and via the dialogue validator, **not** yet run in
> the engine. First engine open may surface minor fixups — tracked in the issue
> list.
